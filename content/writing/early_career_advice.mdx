Here are my thoughts about horizontal career skills that early professionals need to have. My litmus test for “horizontal” was “would a professional need this regardless of industry?”

This post will only cover identifying skills.Outlining how to do and master each skill is a whole other exercise. That’s for a much longer post ;)

# What Horizontal Skills Do Early Professionals Need To Be Effective?

## Operations
### Meetings
How do you successfully organize a group of individuals to deliberate and make progress on a common goal? Expectations, goals, cadence, rhythm, etc. Note: There is a different cadence for virtual vs in-person

### Projects
Often meaningful work requires multiple people and can’t be completed in a single sitting (could take years). How do you successfully scope, execute, complete, and evangelize a project? Especially when people participating in a project are often thinking about multiple things

### Data Fluency
I debated including this, but I’m biased (I’m a data nerd). Since most of our roles are on computers, and computers speak data, it’s important that early career professionals get a 101 understanding of a spreadsheet. It doesn’t have to be advanced, but a general understanding about rows, columns, cells, and if-this-then-that functions will multiply in other areas of work

## Writing 
Writing is the main form of async communication. It is scalable (your words can be multiplied at 0 marginal cost) and has leverage (your written words will communicate for you when you’re not there). How can you increase the chances that your writing will “work” for you while you’re away?
* **Email** - Every early professional needs to learn to send a proper email that completes an objective
* **General** - Off the cuff sub-topics worth emphasizing
* **Bullet points** - Bullet points are useful in two ways 1) they force you to draw boundaries between ideas (aka structure them) and 2) they visually delineate your thoughts to your viewer. Use them often and wisely
* **The Line Break** - The line break is the most underrated tool in writing. Again, it breaks up ideas and structures your thoughts
* **The Hook** - This is really “storytelling” in disguise. The “hook” of your writing catches the reader and increases the chances you complete your writing’s goal. YouTuber Script Writers and Twitter Thread writers are the best at this
* **Titles + Bold** - Visual way to summarize and make your readers' job easier. It also more effectively expresses your intent
* **Proofreading** - This is a skill that is often overlooked. It’s a good idea to have a second set of eyes review your work.
    * **Casual** - Your choice ;)
    * **Most cases** - Once, slowly, with a focused, clear mind
    * **High stakes** - Two times, read it outloud once
*  **Resources** - On Writing Well is my “learn to write” book

## Efficient work
The goal isn’t to work many hours, the goal is to complete an objective. As an early career professional you’ll be working in a larger org. It pays dividends to understand the dynamics in that larger org. There are 3 main areas you need to gain empathy in order to guide and improve your output:
* **Customer Empathy** - Who is your business serving? Have you talked to them? What makes them tick? What’re their priorities?
* **Stakeholder Empathy** - Who is your boss? Your boss’s boss? What’re their priorities? How are they trying to move the business? What are the factors outside your role that influence them? What is the business model of your org?
* **Product Empathy** - You need to understand in depth what your product does. If you don’t have a grasp on a complicated product, you can’t recommend actions to your leaders. (I have scars of this from Salesforce, super complicated product that took effort to learn)

## Mindset
General off the cuff lessons learned that serve horizontally
* Your boss doesn’t have the answers - Quit looking for other people to solve your problems or answer your questions. They don’t have the answers. What would an owner do? Figure it out
* If you don’t market yourself, no one will - As an early career person, doing the work is only 85% of the job. The other 15% is packaging it up and sharing it with your boss and your extended team. This will not only give you valuable feedback for later, but it will increase your surface area for luck
* Career priorities - Can’t write a book for early professions without addressing the “$65K/yr is way better than $59K/yr” fallacy. I advocate for: Learning > Manager (this could be swapped with learning depending on personality type) > Fun > Money
* MECE - Similar to bullet points and line breaks, being able to structure a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list is an incredible superpower. This shows intelligence!
* Controlling yourself - Or “don’t send that nasty-gram.” Learning to control your human side (it’s ok, we all have it) and not making a reputation-harming decision at work
* External Sharing - This one is polarizing, but it’s worth thinking about how to get your name outside the walls of your company. Your #1 advocate needs to be you

## Prioritization
I learned this the hard way at SFDC. They were extreme on prioritization. There was always one list, and item number #1 was always prioritized over item #2. Every item’s placement was intentional. Doing this well at work bleeds into your to do list and general execution. Here’s what I learned about effective prioritization from SFDC. **How to Implement:**
* Starts with culture - Instilling a prioritization mindset in the org is really a culture decision and action. Leadership will 1) Ask you to defend any list you’re presenting to them 2) Ask you to prioritize any list you do and 3) Assume that any list they’re presented is prioritized
* Org Mechanics - Next, your prioritization process needs to be built into the mechanics of the planning process. Every org is different, but SFDC did this through their V2MOM tool
* How to do - Everyone does it differently, but the way I was taught was via a very simple sorting algorithm
    * Start with a pre-prioritized (randomized) list.
    * Compare tem #1 and ask yourself, ‘Is this more important than the one below it?’
    * If so: Keep it where it is and do the same exercise for item #2
    * If not: Move it to number 2 and repeat the exercise comparing new-#2 with #3, then #4 then #5 till your item is more important.”
* **Prioritization criteria** - I usually ask myself a simple question comparing two items, “If I could only have one of these, which would it be?”
    * Why it’s good
        * A lot of decisions can be autonomously done this way. It forces conversations early on so there aren’t more battles later.
        * Forces the writer to think about their opinion
        * Clearly expresses intent async
