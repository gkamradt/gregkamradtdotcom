Stayed in Old Town Dubrovnik. There was a celebrity wedding going on and rumor had it that Leo was in attendance. Nice cars, beautiful people, very game of thrones


Three things I noticed about Dubrovnik:


1. Surprisingly cheap supermarket placed within a very expensive culinary ecosystem
2. People talk about Croatia in terms of how good the cliff jumping is
3. Some of the most beautiful coast/island/sea/water combos I’ve seen
