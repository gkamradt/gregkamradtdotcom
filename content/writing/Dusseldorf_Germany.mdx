Got a cheap flight out of Dusseldorf so I took the train over and hung out for a night. Had barely heard of the city before but turns out that there is a ton of culture there. Ton of expensive stores, even a bougey Apple Store. I walked around for a bit, got a crepe, got a pizza, got a beer, walked back and slept. 


Three Things I noticed about Dusseldorf:


1. Nice fun young culture out on a Tuesday night
2. Many more bougey stores than I knew they had
3. Cars on the road were of the same quality as a London or SF
