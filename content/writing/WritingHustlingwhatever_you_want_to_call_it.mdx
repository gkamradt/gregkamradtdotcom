Wanted to share a line from an email I just got. My friend and I were talking about how he got where he wanted to go and what advice he could give to those are still getting there. I asked him how he made himself stand apart…“As far as standing out I really think it’s being authentic in whatever can set you a part. For me that was writing/hustling (if that’s what u want to call it) for others it was simply there previous pedigree.”



> “For me that was writing/hustling (if that’s what u want to call it) for others it was simply there previous pedigree.”


This line is huge to me. So much life/story/drama/success packed into one sentence. Literally, the treasure chest of your life, whatever the hell is in it, lies at the end of this sentence. 


Hard work, hustling, owning life, is all dependent on your willingness to choose that path. Whenever you’re coming up on a chance for life to work out for you, think to yourself, “What hard work have I put in to get what I want?” Jeez, whenever you have a goal you want to do, think to yourself, “Why do I deserve this? What have I done for it.” Even if you don’t have the background to get the job you want, set yourself apart by the hard work you’re willing to put in. 


Give life a chance to be good to you. Put in as much work as possible and maximize your chances for things to happen for yourself. Work your strengths…even if its not your pedigree.
