Took a bus over from Dubrovnik to Belgrade to get ready for a flight to Istanbul. Getting into the city and walking around I realized that Belgrade was the city that exceeded my expectations the most. 


Three things I noticed about Belgrade:


1. Total beach vibe on Sava Lake
2. Boat clubs docked on the water scattered between abandoned ships have some of the most unique vibes I’ve seen for night life
3. Belgrade has awesome trendy bars like SF, but scattered in a more torn up area
