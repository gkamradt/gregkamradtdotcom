I keep an on\-going list on my phone of things I make sure to show people when they come to SF for the first time. Maybe a few can help out (in no particular order)


1. **Haight\-Ashbury** \- Step inside Amoeba record store then go check out the ridiculously expensive clothing stores   


2. **Golden Gate Bridge** \- Obvious one but make sure you check it out from all views, the north, down from the beach, walk across it, from a boat.  


3. **Exploratorium** \- Some really cool architecture and exhibits going on   


4. **Lumbard Street** \- Worth a cool picture   


5. **Ikes and Delores Park** \- This one is clutch. Ikes has great sandwiches and Delores Park is right around the corner. Get a sandwich, walk a couple blocks to the park, and hang out with everyone.   



6. **Union Square** \- Fun place to walk around. A lot of events go on throughout the year. You’ll get a lot of shopping in while you’re here.   


7. **Cheesecake Factory at Union Square** \- If you need a place to eat check out the Cheesecake Factory up at the top of Macy’s. Make sure you request to sit out side (bring a jacket). If you don’t want to eat at least go and check it out. Local tip: Go early and get your name down for a table and then take the escalators down one floor and lounge on the furnature after a long day in the city.   


8. **Coit Tower** \- Nice view of the city and some history to go along with it   


9. **Seals at Pier 39** \- Standard Touristy function   


10. **Golden Gate Park**\- Lots of different things to do inside but a nice stroll on a nice day will suffice for most   


11. **Att Park** \- Catch a Giants game if you are in season. Go to stub hub and get the cheapest tickets you can find and then walk around.   


12. **Dome at Westfield** \- Not a major thing to see but the Westfield mall is impressive with a cool dome up at the top. Sometimes they have light shows   


13. **Mount Sutro**\- Lot of cool history around this place. Not a great view up at the top but with its close proximity to the Haight its not a bad detour   


14. **New Transbay Transit Center Construction** \- Finally you can check out the construction going on for the new Transbay Transit Center Construction. There isn’t a lot to look at but the potential of what it will be is amazing. Check out[Transbay Center](http://transbaycenter.org/) for more information.   


  
  
Now, you could write a whole post on just the **night life** portion as well.
