Got to the flat in Paris and figured out we had an unreal view. We were down for 7 flights of stairs to walk up to this guy. Every night we watched the sun set behind the tower while drinking wine and eating cheese/bread.


3 things on Paris:


1. Laid back, have a glass of wine culture
2. Eiffel Tower doesn’t get old
3. Cheese/Bread/Wine at sunset looking at the tower is added to the top things of life list
