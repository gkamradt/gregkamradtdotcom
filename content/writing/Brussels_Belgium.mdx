Trained over from Paris to Brussels. Most of the reason we wanted to go to was to visit Delirium in old town. The bar was pretty cool, touristy but cool. Weather was awesome and the sunset walks were the best. 


Three Things I noticed about Brussels:


1. Chocolate is worth the hype
2. Amazing/friendly people
3. Everyone works out mid day
