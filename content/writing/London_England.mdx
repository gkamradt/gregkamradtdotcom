First time I went to London I was a solo backpacker and got over the hostel. This time around we stayed near Green Park at the [Holiday Inn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm6yInXTFHY). Way more fun to be with another traveler exploring.


Four things I noticed about London:


1. The pound to USD conversion is horrible. Pathetic
2. As diverse as NY or SF
3. You pay for a clean tube
4. If you have money, you can do London right
