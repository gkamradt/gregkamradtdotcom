Got into Naples after flying from Dusseldorf. It seems like you have to work just a little bit harder in Naples to get where you need to go. Less descriptive street signs, more people, more side streets, more stairs, less organized traffic. Not complaining but I’ve been spoiled with easy going up till now. Had one of the best pizzas of my life from a place around the corner from the hostel for 4 euro. 


Three things I noticed about Naples:


1. If something falls on the ground, trash/building/signs, it will stay there forever and then get built upon
2. Pizza is king
3. The best opportunities for photos find you. This isn’t a place to go searching for the best spots. Your best shot will be walking around and observing
