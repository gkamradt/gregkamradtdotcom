Last stop with my travel buddy was Amsterdam, its been two weeks of traveling to a ton of cities and taking in a lot of information. Amsterdam was a good place to chill out and smell the roses. 


First thing that I noticed when I got there was the beauty that I didn’t expect. The canals were awesome. Second thing was the bike culture. Kids, parents, dogs, food, business all traveled on bikes. 


Four things I noticed about Amsterdam:


1. Closest city I’ve seen come close to matching the energy of Vegas. Not the same style at all, but the mindset
2. The new “tourist rules” that I heard about were non\-existent
3. The biking culture is impressive
4. Picturesque views all over the canals, underrated beauty
