# Social Engineering/Hustling/Work Arounds \#7


### Use a familiar keyword to warm up a cold email


Now that you’ve gotten your target person that you want to get in front of you need to make a connection. You see, the thing about emails, theres still a first impression. Emails get looked over so quickly that you need to let the reader know that 1\. You’re a real person 2\. What you are saying is relevant and has a point.   
  
**I call this the Slate Magazine Example:**  
  
I am on the job hunt in a **new city** and **emailing** perspective employers all day. No one wants to talk to a **needy job\-seeker** so I had to present myself relevant….sane. In order to do that I chose  to attach myself to a **socially reputable event**, but remember, I know **zero** about my surroundings.  
  
**Objective**: Send a cold email to a consultant at a International Trade firm who happens to be tech savvy (LinkedIn Tip), works downtown and get a call to result from the email.


**Process**  
  
I went over to MeetUp.Com and found the biggest tech talk meeting up in downtown. I wasn’t too interested on the talk, but more on the **location** it was held! I mean big name places are always donating space to get there name out there. I found out that **Slate Magazine hosts a tonnnn of tech talks and has a good name in the city.** I’ll drop that name to anchor me to at least *something.*  
  
Woo!**Yeah got the response. Check out Adams last line:**

Got the call and learned a ton!
