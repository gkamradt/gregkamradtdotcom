Stoked to announce that I just put http://www.ischiaproject.com/ live. Ischia Project started as a way for me to reflect on my time here and a way to keep myself busy. What I’ve found is that interviewing locals is awesome way to get to know an area. 


I’ll be updating the site through May with more pictures and interviews.
