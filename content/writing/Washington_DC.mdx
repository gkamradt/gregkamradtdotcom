People kept asking what I thought about DC. I said I noticed three things


1\. More suits per capita than any other city I’ve been in


2\. Cleanest metro/subway/tube


3\. [High strung night life](http://www.barcelonawinebar.com/washingtondc.htm)


Favorite part: Walking from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial
