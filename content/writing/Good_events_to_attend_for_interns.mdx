What fun things are happening this summer in the Bay Area? Since you are interning I’m going to assume you’re not 21, do not have a whole lot of transportation, want to get a good understanding of the bay and want to diversify your activities to get the most return on your fun to effort ratio. Lets define summer as from mid May till Aug. Lets Listen, Eat, Move, Spectate, and let the good times roll. Let me know if you have anymore questions and let the good times roll.   

## Listening:
  
[BottleRock Napa](http://bottlerocknapavalley.com/) - Concert that started last night, 5/9/2013, there are buses that shuttle from SF if you want to get over there  
  
[SF OutSide Lands](http://www.sfoutsidelands.com/home/) - Big festival going on in Aug. Held in Golden Gate Park. 80% chance you’ll have fun and if the weather is nice that jumps up to 93%  
  
[Live 105 BFD 2013 at Shoreline Ampitheatre](http://www.last.fm/festival/3549868+Live+105+BFD+2013) - BFD has had its ups and downs and I am sad to say this year doesn’t look like an up. It also is the same day as Bay to Breakers which I’m sure will decrease some attendance.  
  
[San Francisco Symphony](http://www.sfsymphony.org/) I haven’t been to a lot of shows here but a cheap ticket is definitely worth the cultural experience.   
  
[The Annual Santa Cruz Blues Festival](http://www.santacruzbluesfestival.com/) Never been but I mean, how could you go wrong?  
  
You can always check out who is playing at Shoreline, [Bottom of the Hill](http://www.bottomofthehill.com/), [The Fillmore | San Francisco](http://thefillmore.com/), [Slim’s Presents | The Great American Music Hall | Slim’s | UC Theatre](http://www.slimspresents.com/), and [The Regency Ballroom](http://www.theregencyballroom.com/) to name a few.   
  
[AUDIUM](http://www.audium.org/) Heard this place is awesome and its on my list of things to do

## Eating:


  
[Off the Grid SF](http://offthegridsf.com/) is a awesome experience. Food trucks galore and with rotating menus you are going to find something you like. I’d recommend the Friday night event over at Fort Mason.

## Moving:


Get some hiking in. Not sure where in the bay you’ll be but [Mountain View - Shoreline Park](http://baytrail.abag.ca.gov/vtour/map3/access/Btmtnvw/Btmtvw2.htm) is for those who are near Mountain View, [Openspace.org - Your Preserves - Rancho San Antonio](http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_rancho_san_antonio.asp) for those nea Los Altos, [Openspace.org - Your Preserves - Russian Ridge](http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_russian_ridge.asp) for those a little more north off 280 and [Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve](http://www.ucsf.edu/about/cgr/current-projects/mount-sutro-open-space-reserve) for those in SF.  
  
[Bay to Breakers - Home](http://www.baytobreakers.com/) This is a really big event for San Francisco and draws a lot of crowds. Participants walk/run from the Bay to Breaker which is on the other side of SF. Totally fun to walk it with friends and people watch. A lot of people just set up on the course, drink/party/dance, and have a good time all day. I put this one in moving but it could easily be in spectating. Oh yea, and do not forget to dress up.



## **Spectating:**


[**The Official Site of The San Francisco Giants**](http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=sf)You have to head to a giants game. Get some friends, cash, an extra sweatshirt, and grab some tickets off [San Francisco Giants Tickets](http://www.stubhub.com/san-francisco-giants-tickets/) on stubhub.   
  
[SF Pride | Parade](http://sfpride.org/parade/) Another big event that SF puts on that draws a lot of people. Not everyone is going to be a fan of this but if you go and enjoy the culture with friends you’ll have a great time.   
  
[CARNAVALSF.COM](http://www.carnavalsf.com/) I’ll let you decide on this one.

## Art and Wine Festivals:


You walk around, grab a beer/wine, keep the glass and enjoy the sun. The moods are surely affected by the weather but I’d go and check them out to get a little culture in there. Here are a few:  
[Palo Alto Festival of the Arts-entertainment-Palo Alto](http://www.mlaproductions.com/PaloAlto/entertainment.html)  
[Los Altos Arts and Wine Festival - Main and State Street](http://events.mercurynews.com/los_altos_ca/events/show/291245647-los-altos-arts-and-wine-festival)  
[Foster City Arts & Wine Festival - Leo J Ryan Memorial Park](http://events.mercurynews.com/san_mateo_ca/events/show/302685925-foster-city-arts-wine-festival)



## 4th of July:


I am not as familiar with all the events for the bay on this one. But if I had to pick a perfect spot to watch these from it would be a rooftop in SF somewhere. If you can’t swing that then I know that Cupertino does a nice little fireworks show that is over crowded. 



  
  



## Wine Tasting:


No need to go all the way up to Napa for good wine. Especially if you can’t tell the difference. Try out these places: [Cooper Garrod Vineyard](http://www.cgv.com/), [Savannah-chanelle Vineyards in Santa Cruz Mountains of California the very best](http://www.savannahchanelle.com/), [Mountain Winery :: Home](http://www.mountainwinery.com/)



  
  
This is a brief list and there are plenty more things to do this summer. If the weather keeps up just try and be outside.
